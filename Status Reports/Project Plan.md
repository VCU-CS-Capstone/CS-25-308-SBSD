**Project:SBSD Web Prototype and GPT**

**Project Description: The Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity (SBSD) https://sbsd.virginia.gov/ would like to create a more interactive, user responsive web site by including chatbot/GPT technology. However, the State of Virginia is concerned about AI and the Governor placed restrictions on itâ€™s implementation (https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/january/name-1019979-en.html) This capstone team will build and deploy a prototype AI that accomplishes the needs of the SBSD while complying with the Governors order. It is expected that this project may serve as a prototype for Commonwealth of VA web sites moving forward.**

**Problem Definition: To build a prototype AI that accomplished the needs of the SBSD while complying with the Governors order.**

**Deliverables: Team Contract**

**Coding Plan: Build a chatbot model using RAG. We will use RAG to use our information instead of the internet's informartion. With this we will be able to comply with the Government's law.**
