# *CS 25-308 SBSD Web Prototype and GPT*
## *Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity*
## *Creating a more interactive, user responsive web site by including chatbot/GPT technology*
The Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity (SBSD) https://sbsd.virginia.gov/ would like to create a more interactive, user responsive web site by including chatbot/GPT technology. However, the State of Virginia is concerned about AI and the Governor placed restrictions on itâ€™s implementation (https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/january/name-1019979-en.html) This capstone team will build and deploy a prototype AI that accomplishes the needs of the SBSD while complying with the Governors order. It is expected that this project may serve as a prototype for Commonwealth of VA web sites moving forward.

The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others who will 
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project.
